# More CSS Properties

### Background

The `background` property is actually a shorthand for 8 different background-related properties.

### Borders

- `border`: basically you just need to define a size, style and color
- `border-radius`: the property that is used to create rounded corners on things

Read the MDN docs for [`border`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) and [`border-radius`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius)

### box-shadow

Property `box-shadow` adds a shadow effect around an element. This is useful to create a sense of depth on your page and to add subtle separation between elements.

In usage it’s pretty simple, but keep in mind that it’s best used sparingly, and subtly. Prefer lighter, barely visible shadows to darker or brighter colors.

Read the [box-shadow docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow).

### Overflow

It is possible, using `overflow`, to define what happens when it’s content is too big to fit. The most common usage is likely to add scrollbars to an element inside a webpage, for example a `card` style element with scrollable content.

### Opacity

Property could you use to make an element transparent.
Check out [`opacity`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity) for a definition and some examples.
